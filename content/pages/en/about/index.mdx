		<p>Hi! I'm Juan Antonio (also known as Juanan or Juan).</p>
		<br />
		<p>I'm <b>Full-Stack Developer</b> and I like to add value both in multidisciplinary teams and individual developing.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Actually I work in Seville as <b>Senior Developer</b> at <a href="htstps://www.lynxspa.com/" target="_blank">Lynx</a>.</p>
		<br />
		<p>I like to learn and create new projects, this is why I have created this site, to share my experience about learnings, ideas and useful documentation for me among other things.</p>
		<br />
		<p>I made this project under a personal brand (stunnin'.dev), because one of my hobbies is design.</p>
		<br />
		<p>This blog was built with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank">Gatsby</a> and it was an adventure for me to develop it while I was learning about <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a>, <a href="https://graphql.org/" target="_blank">GraphQL</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> and many other technologies in the process.</p>
